### Before reaching 1.0.0.RELEASE, I planned to

- Feb 15, 2016 <del>wait until Kotlin's 1.0 release</del>

- Feb 20, 2016 <del>ensure 100% usability in Java by test cases written in Java</del>

<del>According to current testing status, I've already found some issues relate to Kotlin reflection library, and report them to Kotlin team.</del>

- improve unit test coverage to at least 95%
