### Before reaching 1.0.0.RELEASE, I planned to

- ensure 100% usability in Java by test cases written in Java
According to current testing status, I've already found some issues relate to Kotlin reflection library, and report them to Kotlin team.

- improve unit test coverage to at least 95%

- completing documentation here

- and wait until Kotlin's 1.0 release
